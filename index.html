      approaches the world of djing and music production at the tender age of 14 years,
      beginning in several clubs around his province. 
      and creating "hardstyle"tracks.
      From there a series of events will see Angelo (time not yet AnGy KoRe), 
      the protagonist of a lot of club's consolles
      in Italy!
      That until the age of 19 years,
      when his strong desire to try new experiences,
      led him to embark on the most prestigious cruise ships with a
      role of dj.
      3 years around the all world give him the way to discover	
      different cultures of worldwide nightlife,
      musical tastes, new sounds_
      Everything leads him to an artistic rebirth, a renewal
      that by way of his eclectic style,that draws
      an infusion of diverse hard techno, and dark minimal sound.
      Once back on dry land, Angelo immediately transforms his ideas into music,
      baptized himself with the name of AnGy KoRe_
      AnGy KoRe immediately find many satisfactions
      finding his tracks in the playlist of djs all over the world 
      (Richie Hawtin, Umek, Joseph Capriati, The Advent, Nicole Moudaber, Dandi & Ugo,
      Piatto, Ahmet Sendil, Phunk Investigation....).
      Consistently across the various international minimal and techno charts, AnGy KoRe
